1041	3085	"Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene."

1055	2215	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Fair)
1055	2251	A & B.
1055	2259	Sections show a predominantly unencapsulated tumour with no definite connection to adjacent adrenal gland.
1055	2366	The tumour shows variable cellularity in which the great majority of cells have an oncocytic appearance with abundant granular pink cytoplasm.
1055	2510	In less cellular areas tumour cells are separated by mucin or oedema fluid.
1055	2586	The tumour cells are arranged in small acinar and trabecular formations with an intervening fine vascular network.
1055	2702	Adipose tissue focally surrounds the tumour however deposits of adipose tissue are also seen within the tumour.
1055	2815	Numerous thick walled blood vessels are present.
1055	2865	No convincing spindle cell component is seen.
1055	2912	"Although focally some of the tumour cells show bizarre nuclear pleomorphism, mitoses are extremely rare and the Ki67 index is less than 1%."
1055	3053	In two representative sections (blocks B15 & B16) the oncocytic tumour cells blend with cells which appear adrenocortical in nature with abundant multivacuolated clear cytoplasm.
1055	3233	Focally the diathermied resection margin transects the tumour.
1055	3297	The tumour cells show strong positive staining with vimentin and CD10.
1055	3369	"There is moderate staining with NSE and patchy staining with MelanA, PanCK and AE1/3."
1055	3455	"The EMA, calretinin, inhibin, HMB-45, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CK7, CK20, C-kit, Hepar-1 and SMA stains are negative."
1055	3578	COMMENT:
1055	3587	"The differential diagnosis in this case includes an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm, epithelioid angiomyolipoma and renal oncocytoma."
1055	3724	The latter is discounted on clinical grounds (not related to adjacentkidney).
1055	3803	"Although the tumour contains adipose tissue and thick walled blood vessels, there is insufficient immunohistochemical evidence for an angiomyolipoma."
1055	3953	"The favoured diagnosis in this case is an oncocytic adrenocortical neoplasm and due to the size, the tumour would be classified as having borderline malignant potential (Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia criteria).Due to the unusual nature of this tumour a second opinion will be sought."

1055	4370	ADDITIONAL REPORT (24/12/62):
1055	4400	"A/Prof H Martinsen, THE PRINCE CHARLES HOSPITAL, reports:"
1055	4458	"Thank you for the opportunity to see the slides from this case.	PHI: NULL"
1055	4523	As you know large adrenal cortical lesions with oncocytic cytologic features are a very problematic and evolving area in pathology.
1055	4655	"It is clear that theWeiss criteria cannot be applied without modification to oncocytic lesions, therefore other systems such as the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system (LWB) have been proposed as has the reticulin algorithm."
1055	4871	The reason why so many systems have been proposed is that none have been proven to be completely sensitive and specific.
1055	4992	"Despite its very low mitotic rate and proliferative activity, this adrenal cortical tumour displays several worrying features."
1055	5119	Firstly there is quite prominent myxoid change.
1055	5167	"Myxoid change is not definitive, but is a feature which is suggestive of malignancy as it occurs only very rarely in clinically benign disease (Ref: Am J Surg Pathol 2010, pp973-983)."
1055	5351	Secondly the tumour is very large.
1055	5386	Thirdly the tumour displays a worrying growth pattern including some pseudoglandular areas (another feature which is not definitive but occurs more commonly in malignancies than benign tumours).
1055	5581	We have performed additional Immunohistochemistry which is as follows;
1055	5652	Glucocorticoid receptor: Diffuse strong nuclear expression (glucocorticoid score 4+)
1055	5737	IGF2: Positive (perinuclear dot-like pattern)
1055	5783	"We and others have found IGF2 expression to be a very useful marker of adrenal cortical carcinoma and particular useful in identifying tumours with a low proliferative rate (Ref: Endocrine Related Cancer 2009, pp573-583).We have also recently reported that the glucocorticoid receptor over-expressionis a strong marker of low-grade adrenal cortical carcinoma (Ref; Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism 2009, pp4591-4599)- but this finding isyet to be confirmed prospectively or by another group and so should be considered preliminary."
1055	6331	"Therefore on the basis of the very large size of the tumour, the presence of myxoid and pseudoglandular change, and the presence of strong positive staining for both IGF2 and glucocorticoid receptor, I favour this as adrenal cortical carcinoma of myxoid and oncocytic type."
1055	6605	I emphasise that the mitotic rate is low as is the Ki67 proliferative index (<1%).
1055	6688	Therefore the tumour is classified as low-grade.

1057	3390	It is essentially circumscribed and includes hyalinised collagenous areas with scattered non atypical spindle shaped cells and interspersed myxoid areas.
1057	3544	Within the latter are spindle shaped cells but focally are some multi vacuolated lipoblast-like cells.
1057	3647	There is some form of vascularity in thestroma but this is not uniform as it typically seen in myxoid liposarcomas.
1057	3763	Our immunostains show some positivity for S100.
1057	3811	Immunostains for Muc-4 and EMA appear negative.
1057	3859	"I am not certain of the diagnosis.Possibilities I considered were a well differentiated liposarcoma with myxoid areas, an unusual myxoid liposarcoma, a chondroid lipoma, a cellular myxoma and a low grade fibro myxoid sarcoma."
1057	4085	The negative MUC4 immunostain is against thelatter.
1057	4137	The absence of MDM2 amplification on FISH (please see Prof K'Eberling comment below) is against a well differentiated liposarcoma.
1057	4268	Further FISH analysis (DDIT3 & FUS) is pending.
1057	4316	"Kind regards,"
1057	4331	Yours sincerely
1057	4348	Harrier.
1057	4357	Prof Erasmo Greenwaldt comments:
1057	4390	I agree with Prof Kirby report.
1057	4422	I do not have a definite diagnosis for this low grade fibro myxoid tumour.
1057	4497	A/Prof DEON BALCKWELL comments:
1057	4530	I agree with Prof Tarka differential for this most unusual myoid tumour.
1057	4603	"Whilst it is not typical of any of them, I slightly favour an unusual chondroid lipoma but definitely could not exclude a low grade sarcoma."
1057	4744	I await FISH analysis results with interest.
1057	4789	Dr Brittaney Farr comments:
1057	4817	"I agree that this very myxoid neoplasm is difficult to characterise but I think that there are features that are concerning for a myxoid liposarcoma (areas of delicate arborising vessels), ""lymphangioma"" like spaces secondary to pools of mucin, and agree that FISH for evidence of re-arrangement of DDIT3 might be helpful (as requested by Dr Kolkowski)."
1057	5171	COMMENT
1057	5179	FISH:
1057	5185	Interphase FISH for MDM2using the Poseidon MDM2 (1 2q15) & SE 12 Control Probe (Kreatech) shows no evidence of MDM2 amplification MDM2 amplification is seen in virtually all well differentiated liposarcomas.

1059	1088	"Thereis an encapsulated bare area on the posterior margin near the bone margin measuring 55 x 25mm which is covered by strips of retracted muscle (due to fixation, Dr Mitchell clarified was covered with 2cm muscle layer prior to excision)."
1059	1330	"The tumour measures 110mm superior to inferior, 51mm anterior to posterior and 65mm medial to lateral."
1059	1433	The cut surface shows a solid and cystic tumour comprised of pale tan lobulated areas with areas of haemorrhage.
1059	1547	The cystic spacesrange from 4mm to 54mm in maximum dimension.
1059	1610	The cystic areas have a smooth inner lining.
1059	1656	"The medial part of the tumour, in particular, has multiple large cysts, together measuring 30 x 54 x 30mm, and these contain blood stained fluid."

1059	2559	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Grenke):
1059	2598	A.
1059	2602	Sections show a biphasic synovial sarcoma which is partly cystic and partly solid.
1059	2686	Most of the solid component has an appearance similar to the previous core biopsy (19A88853).
1059	2781	This comprises mainly spindle cells in short irregularfascicles and also admixed more epithelioid cells forming palisades and occasional poorly formed gland-like structures.
1059	2955	"The tumour cells have elongated and oval nuclei with fine chromatin, generally small nucleoli and scanty, poorly defined eosinophilic cytoplasm."
1059	3101	"There is also a minor component, around 20% of the tumour sampled, where there is very obvious formation of well formed glands lined by columnar cells, with intervening spindle cell tumour."
1059	3292	The tumour cysts are generally surrounded by a thin rim of solid tumour and are lined by spindled tumour cells.
1059	3405	There are scattered foci of calcification within the tumour.
1059	3467	Mitoses number up toaround 8 per 10 high power fields.
1059	3523	No necrosis is seen.
1059	3545	No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.
1059	3602	"There is some patchy collagenous and myxoid fibrosis adjacent to the tumour, particularly inferiorly, and this presumably represents tumour which has now regressed due to chemotherapy."
1059	3788	However this fibrosis is not particularly prominent and all the tumour identified macroscopically appears to be viable histologically.
1059	3925	No tumour is identified at excision margins.
1059	3971	"Tumour is 0.5mm from the superior margin, 1mm from the posterior margin, 3mm from the medial margin, greater than 10mm from anterior margin, 20mm from the lateral margin and well away from the inferior margin."

1059	4853	The apparently close superior excision margin was discussed with Dr D Sharpnack.
1059	4934	"After viewing a photo of the longitudinal cut surface of the specimen it was realised that muscle anterior and posterior to the tumour had originally been connected superiorly, and that after excision and specimen fixation these muscles had separated and retracted downwards."
1059	5211	The true superior excision margin is therefore considered to be well clear.

1066	1068	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Hiltz)
1066	1107	A & B.
1066	1115	"The peritoneal nodule (specimen A) is a malignant spindle cell tumour, composed of moderately pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in cellular fascicles, with numerous admixed atypical mitoses and patchy chronic inflammation."
1066	1339	"At the edge of the spindle tumour, there are numerous epithelioid to bizarre highly pleomorphic malignant cells."
1066	1452	The intra-abdominal tumour (specimen B) is a high grade malignant epithelioid tumour.

1066	1698	Mitoses and necrosis are readily identified.
1066	1744	IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
1066	1766	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and both tumours showed similar patterns of staining which are as follows:
1066	1883	Tumour cells positive for: Vimentin.
1066	1921	"Tumour cells negative for: Pan-cytokeratin, Melan-A, HMB45, CAM5.2, C-KIT, CD31, CD34, SMA, Desmin, ALK-1 and CD21."

1066	2177	A ki-67 proliferative index highlights approximately 75% of tumour cell nuclei.
1066	2257	COMMENT:
1066	2266	"The peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours are malignant spindle cell and epithelioid tumours, respectively."
1066	2380	"Both tumours have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, and the overall appearance is similar to the retroperitoneal high grade epithelioid and spindle cell sarcoma previously described in the pathology slide review from South Africa in 2057 (51G89448YRC Worldwide)."
1066	2660	These peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours most likely represent a spectrum of morphological atypia within a high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
1066	2825	"Although no lipoblasts are seen, it is possible that these tumours represent foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which could be confirmed with FISH testing for MDM2 amplification."
1066	3008	"There is focal S100 staining in the intra-abdominal tumour, and although additional markers of melanoma such as HMB45 and Melan-A are negative and melanoma is considered less likely, the possibility that this tumour represents metastatic malignant melanoma cannot be entirely excluded."
1066	3295	"There is no significant staining with markers of epithelial, smooth muscle or skeletal muscle differentiation, no evidence of metastatic adenocarcinoma is seen."

353	2234	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr H Delarosa):
353	2275	A.
353	2279	The 40mm tumouris a solitary fibrous tumour with a multinodular configuration.
353	2359	"The closely opposed  tumour nodules are circumscribed,  thinly encapsulated and composed of moderately cellular spindle cells arranged haphazardly, in storiform arrays andin short fascicles."
353	2551	Numerous ectatic haemangiopericytomatous vessels are present and there are foci of stromal myxoid alteration and foci of fibrosis.
353	2683	"The mildly pleomorphic tumour cells are spindled with pointed ends, ill defined cytoplasmic borders, pale granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli."
353	2837	"Mitoses are easily identified and number up to 8 per 10 hpf and there is focal central coagulative necrosis, which may however relate to previous core biopsy sampling."
353	3005	"The tumour is mostly surrounded by unremarkable mature adipose tissue, however, focally the thin fibrous pseudocapsule forms the margin of the specimen at 9 o'clock (<0.1mm clear) (A14)."
353	3192	The 3 o'clock margin is 1mm cleartowards the deep margin (A10) and the true deep margin is 6mm clear (A10) The 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins are well clear.
353	3353	No scar tissue is seen in the overlying subcutis and dermis or adjacent adipose tissue
353	3440	Immunohistochemistry:
353	3463	The tumour cells stain as follows:
353	3498	"Positive:  CD34, BCL-2, CD99, EMA (patchy weak)"
353	3546	"Negative: SMA, Desmin, S100, Melan A, HMB45, CK19."
353	3597	The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 5-10%.
353	3650	COMMENT:
353	3659	The morphological appearances and immunoprofile are consistent with a solitary fibrous tumour.
353	3755	"Haemangiopericytoma is a less specific term, used in older literature, that described tumours that would currently be classified as solitary fibrous tumours, as well as, several other soft tissue neoplasms with similar staghorn vasculature."
353	3998	"Although histological features do not reliably predict behaviour in solitary fibrous tumours, the presence in this case of increased mitotic activity (8 per 10 hpf), possible tumour related coagulative necrosis and areas of moderate cellularity are findings associated with more aggressive (malignant) behaviour."
353	4311	"The tumour, however, lacks other features associated with malignancy such as infiltrative borders and significant nuclear pleomorphism."

583	249	ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (5.6.63)
583	279	AMENDED REPORT (27.4.63)
583	305	The following report replaces the originally issued report.
583	365	In the original report it was stated that no lymph nodes were identified in the perithymic adipose tissue.
583	473	This was written in error.
583	501	There were in fact two negative lymph nodes.
583	547	The diagnosis remains unchanged.
583	581	The report has been corrected and is as follows:
583	630	CLINICAL:
583	640	"Anterior mediastinal tumour,"
583	670	?thymoma.
583	681	Anterior mediastinal tumour lymph node (left phrenic nerve).
583	743	Further information from Dr Busie:
583	778	Intraoperatively the mediastinal tumour appeared circumscribed with no apparent attachment to neighbouring structures including the pericardium.
583	923	MACROSCOPIC:
583	936	"Specimen labelled ""Mediastinal tumour"" consists of a unoriented piece of encapsulated firm tan tissue measuring 75 x 60 x 40mm with loosely attached fat measuring 80 x 50mm with a separate portion of fat attached included measuring 70 x 60mm."
583	1180	The specimen weighs 132.7g.
583	1208	The external surface of the specimen is inked blue.
583	1261	On sectioning the tissue reveals a variegated surface with pink fleshy areas and areas which appear haemorrhagic.
583	1376	The external surface is nodular but appears covered by a variably well defined capsule.
583	1465	The tumour appears to abut the surgical margin focally.
583	1521	"Blocks:  1 to 4 - composite sets and represent a full thickness section through the centre of the tumour; 5 to 10 - representative section of tumour; 11 - six possible lymph nodes; 12 - ?  possible lymph nodes in loosely attached fat; 13 - one possible lymph node in loosely attached fat; 14 to19 further representative sections of tumour with capsule  (14 & 15, 16 & 17, 18 & 19 - composites); 20 to 23 - further representative section of tumour including  margins.."
583	1990	B.
583	1994	"Specimen labelled ""Mediastinal lymph node"" consists of a lymph node measuring 25 x 15mm."
583	2084	Specimen is longitudinally bisected and AE 2 blocks.
583	2137	(TT/bl 15/4/63)
583	2153	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Ravo):
583	2190	A.
583	2194	Sections show the75mm tumour is a microinvasive thymoma which is difficult to morphologically sub-classify.
583	2304	"The mostly encapsulated tumour shows some organotypical features with angulated, mostly acellular, fibrous bands separating large lobules and sheets of tumour cells and there are some perivascular spaces."
583	2510	"Much of the tumour has a WHO type A morphology and comprises relatively bland spindle cells arranged in sheets, trabeculae with some micro-glandular/micro-cystic areas."
583	2679	Pericellular reticulin is demonstrated in these areas.
583	2735	Round to polygonal epithelioid cells arranged in rosette-like structures are also present and compatible with type A morphology.
583	2865	Alesser but significant component displays micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma features with interconnected  nests of bland epithelioid cells and scant admixed lymphocytes separated by lymphoid rich stroma containing scattered lymphoidfollicles but no admixed epithelial cells.
583	3150	"There are multiple foci of definite capsular invasion (eg. Block A5, block A19) into adjacent mediastinal adipose tissue/thymic adipose tissue and no neighbouring mediastinal structures are present."
583	3350	The invasive foci are predominately smooth contoured nodules with a micronodular thymoma and lymphoid rich stroma appearance.
583	3476	"However, in some areas, the type A areas transitions to a minor component, including extracapsular tumour, that shows a sheet-like arrangement of spindled to polygonal with at least mild atypia including irregular grooved nuclei, vesicular chromatin, conspicuous nucleoli and easily identified tumour cell mitoses (numbering up to 5 /10 HPF) (Block A10)."
583	3832	Focal lymphovascular invasion is present within the capsule of the tumour (Block A9).
583	3919	No perineural invasion is seen.
583	3952	"The invasive tumour focally reaches the inked surgical resection margin (Block A 21, Block A6) and these areas show micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma morphology."
583	4123	The capsule of the tumour also forms the margin of resection across a broad front.
583	4208	No evidence of thymic carcinoma is seen.
583	4250	"No lymph nodes are identified in the loosely attached adipose tissue, however, a separate nodule of type A thymoma is present,  presumably microinvasive tumour,  is present here (Block A11)."
583	4441	"Two lymph nodes, present in theperithymic adipose tissue, show reactive sinus histiocytosis but no evidence of malignancy."
583	4564	Immunohistochemistry
583	4585	"Immunohistochemical stains confirm that the type A areas show relatively sparse mature CD3 and CD5 positive T lymphocytes with no immature T lymphocytes (CD1a, CD99 and TdT negative) and scattered CD20 positive B cells."
583	4806	"Scattered dendritic cells, including Langerhans cells (CD1a andS100 positive) are also present."
583	4903	The micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas show restricted keratin (AE1/AE3) expression within the epithelial areas and  no keratin positive cells within the intervening lymphoid stroma.
583	5099	The lymphoid stroma predominantly comprises mixed mature T cells (CD3 and CD5 positive) and CD20 positive B cells.
583	5215	"There is also an admixed immature T cells (CD1a, TdT and CD99) component which show accentuated distribution around the peripheral aspects of the epithelial nests."
583	5380	The Ki-67 proliferation index is low within the bland type A spindle cells areas and  significantly higher within areas showing nuclear atypia (Block A10).
583	5537	"The CD117 stains scattered cells within the epithelial component, possibly admixed mast cells, however, no sheet like pattern of positive staining is seen."
583	5694	"The CD5 stain appears to correspond to the CD3 stain, highlighting T cells, without obvious CD5 expression within the epithelial cells."
583	5831	COMMENT:
583	5840	The invasive thymoma is difficult to subclassify.
583	5891	The tumour shows definite WHO type A areas and separate micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas.
583	5996	By definition these subtypes lack nuclear atypia.
583	6047	"However, the type A tumour appears to transition to foci showing at least mild nuclear atypia and tumour cell mitoses."
583	6166	"These areas don't quite correspond to typical B3 morphology of the WHO classification, as there are no squamoid features or raisinoid nuclear morphology."
583	6321	I am not sure if these foci represent the WHO spindle cell variant of B3 subtype.
583	6404	"According to the Suster Moran classification of thymomas, which divides thymomas into well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated grading categories, and in which the poorly differentiated subtype corresponds to thymic carcinoma, the presence of cellular atypia and mitoses in this tumour warrants classification as a moderately differentiated thymoma (atypical thymoma)."

583	7773	Ottilie Rogstad.
583	7791	MICROSCOPIC REPORT:
583	7811	I agree with your diagnosis of a thymoma with numerous foci of microscopic capsular invasion.
583	7906	Subclassifing thymomas is somewhat subjective and some cases don't fit neatly into different diagnostic categories.
583	8023	I favour this tumour being a type A thvmoma (with areas of micronodular thvmoma with a lvmphoid stroma).
583	8129	"Although there are occasional mitoses in areas, the morphology is still similar to other areas and in my opinion, no convincing areas of type B3 thymoma are seen."
583	8293	The significance of the focally increased mitotic activity and Ki-67 proliferative index is uncertain.
583	8396	There is no thymic carcinoma present.

59	316	CLINICAL:
59	326	E/O soft tissue tumour.  ?Liposarcoma right adductor compartment.
59	393	Sent with deep and superficial margins additional to main specimen.
59	463	Double suture deep.
59	484	Single suture superior.
59	510	MACROSCOPIC:
59	523	A.
59	527	"Specimen labelled ""Lesion right thigh"" and consists of an encapsulated mass received in the fresh state measuring 160 x 120 x 70mm and weighing 676.1g."
59	680	The specimen was oriented by the surgical registrar with the double suture representing the deep margin and the single suture the superior margin.
59	828	The capsule over the deep/posterior margin was disrupted at surgery and was subsequently repaired.
59	928	The fresh specimen was sampled for cytogenetics aswell as tissue banking.
59	1003	"The superficial margin is inked blue, deep black and medial green."
59	1071	The specimen is transversely sectioned from superior to inferior into 16 consecutive slices.
59	1165	"The cut surface shows predominantly firm, homogeneous fatty tissue but there are a few focal myxoid areas."
59	1276	Representative sections in 24blocks.
59	1314	Blocks: 1 to 3 - superior margin; 4 to 6 - lateral margin; 7 to 9 - medial margin; 10 to 12 - superficial margin; 13 to 15 - deep margin; 16 to 19 - inferior margin; 20 to 24 - representative myxoid areas; reselect - 25 - extra block.
59	1550	B.
59	1554	"Specimen labelled ""Deep margin lesion right thigh"" consists of lobulated piece of fatty tissue measuring 23 x 12 x 10mm."
59	1676	The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue.
59	1727	AE 2 blocks.
59	1743	C.
59	1747	"Specimen labelled ""Superior margin lesion thigh"" consists of an irregular and flattened piece of fatty tissue measuring 55 x 33 x 8mm."
59	1883	The cut surface shows predominantly fatty tissue with scattered blood vessels.
59	1963	AE 6 Blocks.
59	1976	(QM/ta  6.12.62)
59	1994	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr O Feusier):
59	2034	A.
59	2039	Sections show a fatty tumour which appears circumscribed.
59	2098	"It consists of sheets and also some lobules of adipocytes, with some intervening bands of dense fibrous tissue."
59	2211	The tumour has been extensively sampled.
59	2253	There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes but no lipoblasts are identified and no atypical cells areidentified in the fibrous bands or elsewhere.
59	2420	There are no histologic features to suggest malignancy.
59	2477	The tumour appeared well circumscribed macroscopically but histologically itabuts excision margins.
59	2578	Adequacy of excision is difficult to assess.
59	2624	"Focally at the edge of the tumour there may be some extension into adjacent skeletal muscle (blocks O5, O5); this is a feature described in intramuscular lipomas."
59	2789	I favour a diagnosis of intramuscular lipoma rather than atypical lipomatous tumour.
59	2875	"A tissue block will be sent to WARIALDA MULTIPURPOSE SERVICE's Hospital for FISH to look for MDM2 amplification; such amplification is identifiable in most atypical lipomatous tumours/ well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcomas, but is absent in benign tumours (Sirvent et al. Am J Surg Pathol 2007; 31:1476-89)."
59	3191	A supplementary report will be issued.
59	3230	The histologic features do not fit for a hibernoma.
59	3282	B.
59	3286	"Sections show fat, skeletal muscle and some fibrous tissue."
59	3347	No definite abnormality is seen.
59	3382	C.
59	3386	Sections show fat and fibrous fascial tissue.
59	3433	No definite abnormality is seen. (ec)
59	3472	DIAGNOSIS:

59	3489	"Right thigh mass:  Fatty tumour, favour intramuscular lipoma, see text."
59	3562	Supplementary report to follow.
59	3595	B.
59	3599	Deep margin right thigh mass:  No definite abnormality.
59	3656	C.
59	3660	Superior margin thigh mass:  No definite abnormality.
59	3715	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.6.62):
59	3747	Interphase FISH showed a normal signal pattern for MDM2 and D12Z3.
59	3815	There was no evidence of MDM2 amplification.
59	3860	Reported by R.
59	3875	"Patrice/Dr O Weynand, EMERGENCY's Pathology."
59	3920	"Conventional cytogenetics detected an abnormal clone with apparent reciprocal translocations between chromosomes 7p and 11p, and 11q, 13q and 17p."
59	4068	There was no loss of material evident.
59	4108	"There were no diagnostic features, and no evidence of a chromosome 12 abnormality was seen."
59	4200	Reported by R.
59	4215	Tarka/Dr O.
59	4227	"Songer, StVincent's Pathology."
59	4259	There are therefore no features on FISH or cytogenetics to suggest that this is an atypical lipomatous tumour/well differentiated liposarcoma.

637	1977	Sections of the tumour show similar appearances to that seen inthe previously excised left colon tumour (24O65140).
637	2093	"It has a lobulated contour and is composed of pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells."
637	2206	"In most areas, these malignant cells appear to be haphazardly arrangedwhile whorled structures are seen in other areas."
637	2326	Scattered foci of osteosarcomatous component are present (Block 17).
637	2395	The surrounding fatty tissue show adipocytic cells with mild size variation in which atypical hyperchromatic cells are seen in the stroma of their fibrocollagenous septae.
637	2567	The aggregate of features is consistent with that of a malignant sarcoma with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising from a well differentiated sclerosing type liposarcoma being favoured.
637	2756	The dedifferentiated component is present at the inferior margin (Block 12) and appears clear of all the other margins.

649	2385	A.
649	2389	Sections of omentum show small deposits of carcinoma with a papilliform architecture with occasional psammoma bodies.The nuclei show mild pleomorphism with occasional intranuclear inclusions.
649	2582	The appearances favour serous adenocarcinoma.

649	2889	The appearance of this carcinoma is that ofendometrioid adenocarcinoma with grade 1 architecture and grade 3 nuclei giving an overall grade of 2.
649	3036	No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.
649	3082	Carcinoma invades to a depth of 9mm through a wall thickness of 11mm.
649	3153	The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.
649	3217	Both ovaries show benign serous cystadenomas and both fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.

650	6103	"Now two separate intracerebral lesions, a complex enhancing lesion in the left posterior frontal periventricular white matter with surrounding oedema."
650	6255	A second exophytic non-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum protrudes from the genu into the right frontal horn.
650	6371	Macroscopic:
650	6384	"Thirty nine (39) slides labelled ""62S02144 JUAN"" were received including 2 intraoperative smears (""A"" and ""B""), 2 haematoxylin and eosin stained frozen sections (""F/S A"" and ""F/S B""), 11 haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections (""AFS1"", ""BFS1"", ""C1"", ""C1 recut 1-6"", ""C2"", ""Dl""), 2 sections stained for reticulin (""C1"" and ""D1""), 17 sections from block C1 immunostained for NeuN, chromogranin A, 68kD neurofilament protein, p53, GFAP (x2), synaptophysin, vimentin (x2), CD34, Ki-67, IDHIR132H, MIC2, pancytokeratin, CD68, EMA and TTFI, and 5 sections from block D1 immunostained for 68kD neurofilament protein, lDH132H, pancytokeratin, CD34 and TTFI."
650	7043	Microscopic:
650	7056	B and D (Left periventricular frontal tumour).
650	7103	"Multiple fragments of tumour consisting of moderately pleomorphic elongated cells, predominantly arranged in interweaving bundles."
650	7235	Scattered cells with nuclear pseudoinclusions are identified.
650	7298	Mitoses are easily found and the Ki-67 labelling index is approximately 20-30%.
650	7379	Foci of necrosis are present and there is prominent microvascular proliferation.
650	7461	Compared to the right frontal tumour (see below) this lesion is more cellular and the cells more uniform and less pleomorphic.
650	7588	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only and highlight the microvascular proliferation.
650	7691	The tumour cells are strongly Vimentin positive and many are also GFAP positive.
650	7772	There is moderate granular membranous and some cytoplasmic MIC2 staining.
650	7846	CD34 stains endothelial cells.
650	7878	"There is a small amount of focal patchy interstitial staining, although this is much less prominent than in the contralateral lesion (see:below)."
650	8025	"Scattered strongly p53 : positive cells are noted, probably <5%."
650	8090	Compared to the contralateral lesion there are also more numerous weakly staining cells.
650	8179	"The majority ofthe tumour cells are negative for EMA although very rare cells, especially at periphery of several tissue fragments contain an EMA-positive paranuclear dot."
650	8352	"Stains for NeuN, chromogranin, synaptophysin, pancytokeratin, IDH1 RI25H and TTFI are negative."
650	8448	A and C (Right frontal corpus callosum tumour):
650	8496	The intraoperativesmear contains two populations of cells.
650	8556	"The predominant component consists of cells with large round or lobated nuclei of slightly different sizes with a thin, well defined nuclear membrane, uniformly granular chromatin containing several chromcentres and often a prominent nucleolus."
650	8802	Scattered binucleate cells are noted and a number of these nuclei also containing pseudoinclusions.
650	8903	There is a minor component of relatively uniform cells with elongated round ended nuclei but no nucleoli.
650	9010	Some -perivascular lymphocytes are noted but no vascular proliferation is seen.
650	9090	The permanent sections consist of multiple pieces of tissue including fragments of normal cerebral cortex and fragments of solid tumour.
650	9227	The tumour is moderately cellular and pleomorphic.
650	9279	Many of the tumour cells have medium to large round or lobated nuclei with a prominent nucleolus and a small amount of well delineated perinuclear clear to granular cytoplasm.
650	9456	A number also contain nuclear pseudoinclusions and several are bi- or trinucleate.
650	9540	"Scattered triangular cells with darkly staining amphophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei are also included as are cells with large, hyperchromatic somewhat ""smudgy"" chromatin, cells with ovoid nuclei and perinuclear halos, and some with finely vacuolated cytoplasm."
650	9814	"Although a number of these cells resemble dysplastic neurons, stains for neural antigens including neurofilament protein, NeuN, synaptophysin and chromogranin are negative."
650	9987	"In some areas the interstitium is finely vacuolated and slightly basophilic, suggesting mucin."
650	10083	There are scattered micro-cysts and very rare calcospherites.
650	10146	No Rosenthal fibres or eosinophilic granular bodies are identified with haematoxylin and eosin.
650	10242	No ependyma is identified.
650	10269	"Perivascular chronic inflammatory cells are noted, often surrounding veins with some adventitial fibrosis."
650	10377	There is no vascular proliferation or necrosis and mitotic figures are not identified.
650	10465	The Ki67 labelling index is low (visually estimated at approximately 2%).
650	10539	"Although in one fragment the tumour appears to be well demarcated from the surrounding dense paucicellular fibrillary gliosis, neurofilament antibodies highlight prominent axons bundles traversing the tumour."
650	10749	These are accentuated adjacent to vessels.
650	10793	In some areas beaded axons and axonalspheroids are also noted.
650	10856	Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only.
650	10913	"The GFAP staining is generally pale and most of the tumour cells do not show cytoplasmic immunoreactivity adjacent to the nucleus, although scattered GFAP positive processes are noted, especially adjacent to vessels."
650	11131	These processes do not radiate towards the vessels as seen in ependymal perivascular pseudorosettes.
650	11232	"In addition to normal endothelial staining there is very strong, uniform CD34 immunoreactivity between the tumour cells resulting in haloes of CD34 negative cytoplasm surrounding-tumour nuclei."
650	11427	Included fragments of cerebral cortex show the expected normal endothelial staining.
650	11513	"Vimentin also shows prominent dark interstitial staining in many of the tumourfragments, although less intense than the CD34 staining, as well as some cytoplasmic staining."
650	11687	Prominent activated microglia and scattered macrophages are noted within the tumour with CD68 antibodies.
650	11793	Approximately 4-5% of tumour nucleiare weakly p53 positive.
650	11853	"NeuN identifies normal neurons in cortical fragments but not tumour cells. lmmunostains for synaptophysin, IDH R125H, chromogranin, pancytokeratin and TTFI are negative."
650	12024	MIC2 (CD99) is also negative although there is high background staining.
650	12097	"FISH analysis (Dr R Maltez, CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE's Hospital) on the right frontal tumour was negative for lp/19q loss although polysomy for Ip and 19q was demonstrated."
650	12285	There was no EGFR amplification.
650	12318	"MGMT methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (Dr Koori Challis, QUILPIE HOSPITAL Cancer Centre) demonstrated MGMT promoter methylation in both tumours."
650	12469	Diagnosis:
650	12480	Left frontal tumour:  GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV)
650	12530	Right frontal tumour:  DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE II; see Comment)
650	12602	Comment:
650	12611	The right frontal lesion is a low grade glioma without high grade features and is best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).
650	12751	"However, a number of unusual morphological findings are noted, including the very limited GFAP staining and the strong CD34 immunoreactivity, that are not typical of most WHO grade II diffuse astrocytomas."
650	12957	"Although limited or absent GFAP staining is described in some subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, there are no other features supporting this diagnosis."
650	13113	"Similarly, although CD34 immunoreactivity is a feature of many glioneuronal tumours and of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, the other morphologicaland immunohistochemical findings in this case do not support these diagnoses."
650	13337	The relationship between the left and the right frontal lesions is uncertain.
650	13416	"Although they are radiologically and morphologically distinct, suggesting separate lesions, the possibility of microscopic continuity or a common origin cannot be entirely excluded."
650	13598	FISH analysis to assess Ip and 19q polysomy and EGFR amplification will be performed on the left frontal glioblastoma.
650	13718	"If clinically indicated, further genetic analysis may be helpful."
650	13784	"This case was reviewed by Dr Arie Perry (Director of Neuropathology, UCSF) who agreed that the left frontal lesion is a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV)."
650	13934	"He also agreed that the right frontal tumour is unusual but considered that the features were those of a low grade tumour, best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II)."
650	14114	commented that he had also seen low grade astrocytomas with limited GFAP immunoreactivity.
650	14206	"He suggested that further immunostaining for other glial markers,"
650	14272	"including Olig-2, Sox-2 and S100, might-be helpful."

806	1019	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr S Nannen)
806	1059	The gastric tumour is a 32mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).
806	1128	"The GIST is predominantly circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin and expands the muscularis propria."
806	1237	The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in broad interweaving fascicles.
806	1353	"In areas, the tumour cells appear moderately pleomorphic with variably sized nucleoli."
806	1440	There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation.
806	1511	"Centrally, the tumour shows prominent stromal oedema and hyalinosis."
806	1580	Mitoses are present up to 3 per 50 high power fields.
806	1634	Necrosis is inconspicuous.
806	1661	"The tumour is largely surrounded by muscularis propria, but focally extends close to, but does not appear to involve, theserosal surface."
806	1799	The tumour is clear of the gastric resection margins (0.56mm).
806	1862	The overlying gastric mucosa shows no significant histologic abnormality.
806	1937	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:
806	2011	"Tumour cells positive for: CD117, CD34."
806	2051	"Tumour cells negative for: SMA, Desmin, S100, CAM5.2."
806	2105	The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 7% of tumour cell nuclei.
806	2194	COMMENT:
806	2203	The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST).
806	2315	"Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours less than 50mm in size and with a low mitotic rate (less than 5/50hpf), are typically associated with a low risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM)."
806	2565	"Please correlate with clinical, radiologic and intra-operative findings."

810	2273	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Kranawetter):
810	2318	A.
810	2322	Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.
810	2364	Sections of the endometrium show that the described polyp is benign.
810	2434	The endometrium elsewhere is thin and inactive.
810	2483	Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.
810	2528	The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.
810	2571	Focally on the serosa of the anteriorand posterior uterus there are psammoma bodies with associated fibrous tissue and very occasional degenerate tumour cells.
810	2732	The features are consistent with focal serosal involvement by treated tumour.
810	2811	"Sections of the left fallopian tube show poorly differentiated serous carcinoma quite extensively involving the tube wall and serosa, and also extending to involve part of the mucosa."
810	2996	No carcinoma in situ is identified in the residual tubal lining epithelium or at the fimbrial end.

810	3359	B.
810	3363	Sections show omentum with one large deposit and multiple other deposits of serous carcinoma.
810	3458	This is moderately differentiated.
810	3494	There is some evidence of chemotherapy effect with some replacement of tumour by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.
810	3614	This is assessed as less than 50% tumour replacement by fibroblastic and inflammatory tissue.
810	3709	"Comment:  The involvement of the wall of the left fallopian tube is quite extensive and there is some mucosal involvement but the pattern of tumour suggests spread inwards from the serosa, rather than tubal origin."

821	3722	SPECIMEN
821	3731	"Received from the HILLSTON DISTRICT HOSPITAL Hospital KIAMA DOWNS, 1 block labelled ""90B75091_B4""."
821	3830	PATHOLOGY
821	3840	Histological Typing: Spindle cell malignancy
821	3885	The sample was reviewed by a pathologist and was considered to have 50% tumour cells within thearea selected for analysis.
821	4008	TEST DESCRIPTION
821	4025	"The sample wasanalysed for mutations at or surrounding codon 600 within exon 15 of the BRAF gene encompassing the region containing 97% of all BRAF mutations, using high resolution melting (HRM) analysis (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [1]).Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation."
821	4350	This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.
821	4469	RESULT NO MUTATION DETECTED
821	4498	INTERPRETATION
821	4513	No BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors.
821	4664	Comments
821	4673	"BRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases(90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]."
821	4849	V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.
821	4980	"Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]."
821	5111	The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].

831	3585	"A binary scheme has been proposed for grading appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei, with all tumours with significant spread beyond right lower quadrant (bona fide pseudomyxoma) termed mucinous carcinoma peritonei (low grade versus high grade)."
831	3828	This low/high grade stratification is similar to Ronnett scheme and WHO.
831	3902	"Tumours with intermediate or hybrid features (PMCA-Intermediate -Ronnett) are grouped with low grade tumours in the Bradley scheme in view of similar behaviour in their series, and in a later series (Chua 2012), but less favourable behaviour was described in the earlier Ronnett series for this intermediate group."
831	4217	This type of tumour would generally but not exclusively be of appendix origin.
831	4296	"From the sections available from the previous appendicectomy from 19/12/2060, although there is a small mucosal probable adenomatous lesion present in one of the sections (see separate review), it would be difficult to definitely conclude that this was the primary lesion histologically."
831	4584	The peritoneal mucinous neoplasm epithelium is more eosinophilic and not very similarto the small atypical focus in the appendix.

840	1369	(TZ/mm 22.11.62)
840	1387	MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Robbins):
840	1427	Sections of the largest lymph node show extensive involvement by amalignant spindle cell tumour.
840	1525	A further twenty six (26) nodes were identified in the specimen and these all show non-specific reactive changes only.
840	1645	The apical node is not involved by spindle cell tumour.
840	1702	"The spindle cells are in haphazard fascicles and have large, pleomorphic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm."
840	1811	"Mitoses are frequent, numbering around 20 per 10 HPF, and some abnormal mitoses are noted."
840	1903	There is a small area of infarct-like necrosis in the node but no other tumour necrosis is seen.
840	2001	No differentiating features are identified with routine staining.
840	2068	There is a moderate number of admixed benign small lymphocytes and plasma cells amongst the tumour cells.
840	2175	"There is some residual lymphoid tissue, with hyperplastic follicles, at the periphery of the node."
840	2275	"There is some probable extranodal tumour spread, with a pushing margin (blocks 23, 24) but soft tissue margins appear to be free of tumour."
840	2417	IMMUNOSTAINS:
840	2431	S100 - positive.
840	2448	"Melan-A, HMB 45 - negative."

840	2895	Vimentin - positive.
840	2917	"Ki-67 - moderate proliferation index, around 30%."
840	2967	The appearances are interpreted as a high grade sarcoma in a lymph node.
840	3041	It stains S100 and Fascin positive and also shows some patchy CD68 positivity.
840	3121	I favour this being a primary nodal sarcoma and the immunophenotype fits best with an interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma.
840	3248	These are very rare tumours which most commonly present with solitary lymph node involvement.
840	3343	The clinical course is said to be generally aggressive.
840	3401	"I will send the slides to Dr K Magnan, OPERATING THEATRES Pathology, for an opinion and issue a supplementary report."
840	3520	DIAGNOSIS:
840	3533	"Left axillary tissue:  High grade sarcoma involving one lymph node (1/27), favour interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma."
840	3655	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  (21.12.62)
840	3694	"The slides were sent to Dr FAUSTO Kedra, Anatomical Pathology, for review."
840	3770	He replies as follows:
840	3793	"The H&E sections supplied are Blocks 17 to 24 from the single largest lymph node which is virtually replaced by a malignant spindle cell tumour.	PHI: NULL"
840	3939	These sections also include 3 separate smaller lymph nodes which show reactive changes and appear uninvolved by malignancy.
840	4063	The tumour is composed of short and intersecting fascicles of spindled cells with occasional small groupings of more epithelioid cells.
840	4199	"The tumour cells show considerable nuclear pleomorphism with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, vesicular chromatin and plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm."
840	4351	Occasional tumour giant cells areseen.
840	4390	There are scattered foci of tumour necrosis and there is brisk mitotic activity with occasional atypical mitoses.
840	4504	"These cells show both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for S100 protein as well as staining for vimentin, fascin andWT1 (WT1 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH stain)."
840	4663	These cells appear negative for melan-A and HMB45 both on the Devon Energy stains and PATHOLOGYWEST stains.
840	4771	They are also negative on our staining for tyrosinase and MITF1.
840	4837	Schmorl's stain for melanin is negative.
840	4878	"They are also negative for multiple cytokeratins including pan cytokeratin, cytokeratin 19 and the cytokeratins listed in Dr Jamison's report."
840	5021	They are also negative for EMA.
840	5053	"The tumour cells appear negative for leukocyte common antigen, CD20, CD3, CD30, PAX-5 and EBV-LMP."
840	5152	"They appear negative for histiocytic and dendritic cell markers CD163, CD68, CD1a, langerin, CD21, CD23, CD35, and CD4, which highlight background histiocytic and dendritic cells only."
840	5337	They are negative for smooth muscle markers Desmin and smooth muscle actin.
840	5413	"In the background there is some residual lymphoid cells including occasional reactive follicles, compressed to the periphery of the node."
840	5551	"Overall, I think the most likely diagnosis is metastatic melanoma."
840	5618	"I have not had much experience with interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma as these are rare tumours, but from the literature they are describedas usually having more bland nuclei without necrosis and a lower mitotic rate and they often show variable staining for CD68, lysozyme and CD45."
840	5907	"Review of the atypical melanocytic lesion removed from the left arm in 2061 is recommended.If you have access to SOX10 immunoperoxidase, this might prove helpful."
840	6071	Unfortunately we have only just received a sample of the antibody and have not been able to get it working as yet.
840	6186	Electromicroscopy might also be considered if there is still doubt over the diagnosis after review of the skin lesion.
840	6305	DIAGNOSIS:
840	6316	"LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE: MALIGNANT SPINDLE CELL TUMOUR FAVOURING METASTATIC MELANOMA""."
840	6404	(End of Dr Violette's report).
840	6436	"With the further history obtained that there was an atypical pigmented lesion removed from the left arm in December 2061, I agree that it seems that the diagnosis is most likely to be metastatic malignant melanoma"
840	6652	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.12.62):
840	6685	"The slides were referred to Prof K Tuffey, VICTORIAN HEART HOSPITAL Hospital, for review as requested."
840	6788	He also favours a metastatic spindle cell or desmoplastic melanoma.
840	6856	The slides were also reviewed at GATTON HOSPITAL by Prof K Cokel and Dr K Sobran.
840	6939	They also agree that metastatic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.
840	7011	They also reviewed the slides of the previousskin excision (KZ-95-13136).
840	7086	"They comment that there are some atypical spindle cells and that it could represent the primary, however they do not think that there is enough evidence for a definite diagnosis on the limited suboptimal material that is available for assessment."
840	7333	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (17.1.62):
840	7365	A tissue block was sent to ONCOLOGY (GYNAE)'s Pathology for BRAF mutation detection.
840	7450	Targeted BRAF mutation analysis on DNA extracted from the block was negative.
840	7529	No mutation was detected.
840	7555	Interpretation:  The tumour sample does not carry a known BRAF gene mutation that affects codon 600 of the BRAF protein.
840	7677	This patient is not expected to benefit from treatment with a BRAF inhibitor based therapy (Chapman et al.  NEJM 2011; 364: 2507-16).

861	2643	TheKi-67 proliferation index is about 2 to 3%.
861	2691	CD34 is strongly expressed within the tumour.
861	2738	The surrounding liver tissue shows macro-steatosis.
861	2791	There is no significant inflammation.
861	2830	There is no evidence of architectural change or cirrhosis.
861	2890	Comment:
861	2899	"Sections show a solitary hepatocellular tumour (35mm), which is difficult to classify."
861	2987	The overall appearances are favouring those of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.
861	3081	The main differentialdiagnosis is hepatocellular adenoma.
861	3140	Hepatocellular carcinoma usually arises in the background of cirrhosis but no cirrhosis is seen here.
861	3243	Hepatocellular adenoma is strongly linked to female contraceptive pills/steroids and male cases without linkage to contraceptive pills/steroids are extremely rare.
861	3408	This case will be sent to Prof Gerald SPANICEK of PROSERPINE HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.
861	3530	B.
861	3534	Sections of gallbladder show features of chronic inflammation.
861	3598	The cystic duct lymph node shows no significant abnormality.
861	3660	There is no evidence of malignancy.

861	3919	"Reported by Prof Stefan OTANO, WEE WAA COMMUNITY HOSPITAL Hospital."
861	3987	"I favour a diagnosis of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, rather than an adenoma, since the lesion has areas with thick trabeculae (>3 cells), focal loss of reticulin fibres, unaccompanied arteries and stromal invasion."
861	4220	Focally there are a few pseudo glandular structures (dilated bile canaliculi).
861	4300	Scattered mitotic figures arealso seen.
861	4341	No vascular invasion is identified.

871	1071	MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr G Taranto - 16.1.2062)
871	1123	The gastric tumour is a 95mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).
871	1192	"The GIST expands the subserosal tissue and appears circumscribed with a lobulated, pushing margin."
871	1291	"The tumour is moderately cellular and is composed of bland spindled cells arranged in short fascicles with areas of intervening stromal hyalinosis, oedema and very focal necrosis."
871	1471	There is widespread conspicuous paranuclear cytoplasmic vacuolisation.
871	1542	Mitoses are present up to 5 per 50 high power fields.
871	1596	"The tumour is 5.5mm from the gastric resection margin and extends close, but does not involve, the overlying serosal surface."
871	1722	The overlying gastric mucosa shows a mild to moderate non-specific chronic gastritis.
871	1809	Immunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:
871	1883	"Tumour cells positive for: CD117, CD34, focal SMA and focal desmin."
871	1951	Tumour cells negative for: S100.
871	1985	The Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 3-5% of tumour cell nuclei.
871	2076	COMMENT:
871	2085	The morphologic and immunohistochemical features areconsistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST).
871	2196	"Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours between 50 and 100mm in size and with mitotic rate of 5/50hpf, are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM)."

893	1872	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Y Eclarinal):
893	1915	Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.
893	1988	The tumour has infiltrated through the full thickness of the bowel wall and involves the serosa.
893	2086	In one area the serosa is inflamed and haemorrhagic and it is debateable whether tumour cells have breached the serosa.
893	2207	However in my view this layer has not definitely been breached by tumour (pT3).
893	2288	"The carcinoma also shows early invasion of the mesentery, and abuts the appendiceal orifice and ileocaecal valve."
893	2402	The appendix shows a small mucocele as a result of adenomatous epithelial lining (cystadenoma) rather than as a result of obstruction.
893	2537	The right colon contains a single tubular adenoma with mild dysplasia.
893	2608	Four (4) of the eighteen (18) mesenteric lymph nodes identified contain metastatic carcinoma and one of these shows a focus of perinodal spread.

893	3959	"Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene."

897	2915	Focally just beneath the serosal surface of the posterior cervix there is a deposit of serous carcinoma.
897	3021	The cervix is otherwise unremarkable.
897	3061	Sections of the endometrium show that this is mainly inactive and there is a benign endometrial polyp.
897	3165	However there are foci of serous carcinoma in situ in the endometrium.
897	3237	No myometrial invasion is seen.
897	3270	No lymphovascularinvasion is seen.
897	3305	There are leiomyomas and there is adenomyosis in the myometrium.
897	3371	On the serosal surface of the uterus there are scattered foci of high grade serous carcinoma bothanteriorly and posteriorly.
897	3498	Sections of the left fallopian tube show invasive serous carcinoma at the fimbrial end.
897	3587	The invasive tumour measures around 6mm in main diameter.There is also carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes.
897	3722	Sections of both ovaries show quite extensive moderately differentiated serous carcinoma on the serosal surfaces but only focally more deeply within the ovaries.
897	3885	The main described cyst in the left ovary is benign.
897	3940	A section of the right parametrium shows focal serous carcinoma on the serosal surface.
897	4028	The left parametrium is unremarkable.

897	4804	D.
897	4809	Omentum:  Serous carcinoma.
897	4838	COMMENT:
897	4847	"The features are most consistent with a primary moderately differentiated serous carcinomaof the fimbrial end of the left tube, with metastases in the omentum, on the serosa of both ovaries and on the uterine serosa."
897	5065	There is also serous carcinoma in situ in the endometrium but it is noted thatthe previous uterine curettings and cervical cone biopsy (44S69897) showed extensive serous carcinoma in the endometrium and serous carcinoma involving cervical glands and stroma.
897	5324	The endometrial and cervical tumour also seem likely to be metastatic from the left tube.
897	5415	There is also serous carcinoma in-situ at the fimbrial end of the right tube.
897	5494	SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (28.8.63):

904	2814	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr P Berta):
904	2853	A-C.
904	2859	Sections show three separate invasive carcinomas.
904	2910	The main carcinoma at 1-2 o'clock 45mm FN is a grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 1).
904	3009	A separate grade 2 infiltrating lobular carcinoma (tumour 2) is present around the large  subareolar ducts of the nipple and is approximately 30mm from the main carcinoma.
904	3182	An incidental 2.3mm grade 1 infiltrating tubular carcinoma (tumour 3) is present about 2mm deep to tumour 2.
904	3293	"Paraffin sections of the single sentinel lymph node show a minute cluster of tumour cells with occasional intracytoplasmic lumina within the subcapsular sinus measuring <0.1mm in maximum dimension (detected on an H&E stained section, block A1L2)."
904	3540	"This particular area has cut out on deeper levels examined with H&E and keratin immunostains, however, in adjacent tissue in the same cross section keratin immunostained sections reveal further dispersed single tumour cells within the subcapsular sinus distributed over an area of 4mm."
904	3827	"The total number of tumour cellsin this cross section, both H&E and keratin immunostain detected number less than 200 cells and is consistent with node involvement by isolated tumour cells of lobular carcinoma."
904	4039	"However in a separate cross section of the sentinel lymph node, keratin immunostains reveal a further minute cluster of cohesive and single tumour cells 0.3mm in dimension as well as dispersed single cells in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses, distributed over an area of 5mm."
904	4321	"While an interpretation of this second separate focus of intranodal tumour cells as isolated tumour cells is possible (the 0.3mm cluster is not strictly a completely cohesive and expansile cluster and the total number of tumour cells in this crosssection number less than 200 cells), I have classified it as a micrometastasis (recognizing overlap in the definition)."

909	2081	"Sectionsshow a high grade carcinoma arranged in sheets, trabeculae and papillae containing fibrovascular cores, with extensive areas of necrosis."
909	2228	The tumour cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with pleomorphic nuclei containing coarse chromatin and small nucleoli.
909	2367	Focally the tumour has a squamoid appearance and no glandular formation is seen.
909	2449	Abundant mitoses are present.
909	2480	"The tumour lies adjacent and focally adherent to the ovary, which otherwise appears normal."

909	2737	COMMENT:
909	2746	"Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different."
909	2952	"The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6."
909	3053	The CA125 stain is negative.
909	3082	"It is thus concluded that the current tumour may not represent a recurrence of urothelial carcinoma, but instead is favoured to represent a poorly differentiated mulleriancarcinoma."
909	3265	"As a normal ovary and fallopian tube are present, the tumour may be of peritoneal origin."
909	3355	B.
909	3359	The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.
909	3423	The endometrium is inactive and contains a small benign endometrial polyp.

912	1226	Sections show small intestinal wall with a neuroendocrine tumour.
912	1293	"This consists of nests, trabeculae and cords of cells with medium sized and large, relatively uniform round nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm."
912	1458	The nuclei have fine granular chromatin and sometimes a small nucleolus.
912	1532	Some tumour cells have pink cytoplasmic granules.
912	1583	The tumour forms occasional small glands.
912	1626	The mucosal surface of the tumour is ulcerated.
912	1675	"It arises from the mucosa and invades through the muscularis propria with an infiltrative appearance, and into subserosal tissue."
912	1806	It appears to breach the serosal surface very focally.
912	1862	The assessment of lymphovascular invasion is difficult because of retraction artefact around the tumour cell nests but there is considered to be some lymphovascular invasion in the bowel wall and also multifocal lymphovascular invasion in the attached mesentery.
912	2126	No perineural invasion is identified.
912	2165	"Mitoses are infrequent, less than 1 per 10 high power fields, and there is no tumour necrosis."

925	1758	(TO: DF; BW/mm 3.12.63)
925	1783	MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr W Poczobut)
925	1825	Sections show three separate subcapsular deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma ranging from 10mm to 90mm in maximum dimension.
925	1968	The deposits are predominantly composed of a cribriform or fenestrated arrangement of large malignant glands lined by cells with moderately pleomorphic nuclei.
925	2129	There is  prominent central necrosis within the complex large glands.
925	2200	A lesser component of smaller malignant tubular glands is also present.
925	2273	No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen (some peritumoural retraction artefact and tumour carry over).
925	2382	The closest deposit is 17mm clear of the surgical resection margin and abuts but does not appear to penetrate the liver capsule at the bare (non-peritonealised) area of the liver (block 14).
925	2573	Away from the deposits the liver displays a normal lobular architecture.
925	2647	"The portal tracts contain a normal complement of bile ducts, hepatic arteries and hepatic veins and there is no significant portal fibrosis or inflammation."
925	2805	Apart from minimal patchy macrovascular steatosis the hepatocytes are unremarkable.
925	2890	An occasional portal Von-Meyenberg complex (bile duct hamartoma) is noted.
925	2966	The gallbladder is essentially normal.
925	3007	Immunohistochemistry:
925	3029	The tumour cells stain as follows:
925	3064	"Positive:  CK20 (patchy minimal), TTF1 (Novocastra clone SPT24 - diffuse strong), CDX2 (diffuse strong)."
925	3169	"Negative:  CK7, ER, PR, CA125."
925	3200	COMMENT:
925	3209	In the context of a rectal lesion the morphological appearances and diffuse CDX2 immunoexpression are compatible with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.
925	3362	"However, the presence of minimal patchy positive tumoural CK20 immunostaining and diffusely positive TTF1 immuonstaining is unusual for colorectal carcinoma."
925	3521	Thelatter finding is more typically seen in lung adenocarcinoma or thyroid carcinomas but positive expression has been reported in a subset of colorectal adenocarcinomas with the TTF1 antibody used in this case (Novocastra SPT24 clone).
925	3759	Further clinical and radiological correlation is advised.
925	3817	Comparison with the morphological appearances of the rectal biopsy may be helpful.
925	3901	DIAGNOSIS:
925	3912	Right hemihepatectomy:
925	3935	-  Three deposits of metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma 10 to 90mm in maximum dimension (see comment).
925	4055	-  17mm clear of surgical resection margin and abutting the bare (non-peritonealised) area of the liver.

993	4885	"BRAF mutations are foundin 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1-2]."
993	5061	V600E specific BRAF inhibitors e.g. vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been developed toinhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.
993	5191	"Trials of these inhibitors have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3,4,5]."
993	5322	The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [6].

file1732	1350	MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Fine):
file1732	1387	Sections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle.
file1732	1493	There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat.
file1732	1590	The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis.
file1732	1634	"The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved."
file1732	1704	"The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli."
file1732	1869	Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF.
file1732	1946	Necrosis is not identified.
file1732	1974	"There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour."
file1732	2102	The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages.
file1732	2243	These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour.
file1732	2349	No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.
file1732	2400	The tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:
file1732	2451	#NAME?
file1732	2470	"-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells)."

file1732	2710	Nuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.
file1732	2753	The Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.
file1732	2838	The overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
file1732	2962	The cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14).
file1732	3035	"However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells ."
file1732	3171	"These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed."
file1732	3392	"This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15)."

file28387	4506	"The mild and moderate chronic inflammatory infiltrate in portal tracts are non-specific, but the presence of eosinophils raises the possibility of a drug reaction."
file28387	4671	C.
file28387	4675	Sections of the described circumscribed tumour mass lateral to the kidney show a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.
file28387	4790	"This consists of fascicles of spindle cells with pleomorphic, sometimes very large atypical nuclei."
file28387	4891	"Mitoses are frequent, numbering up to around 18 per ten high power fields."
file28387	4967	There are small foci of fat within the tumour.
file28387	5015	No heterologous elements are identified.
file28387	5057	Much of the high grade tumour is circumscribed but there is some extension into the surrounding tissue and it is considered that high grade sarcoma extends to part of the lateral soft tissue margin focally (block C4).
file28387	5275	"Fat adjacent to the high grade tumour and elsewhere in the specimen, including most or all of the perinephric fat, is abnormal."
file28387	5404	"This shows features of an atypical lipomatous tumour / well differentiated liposarcoma, comprising mainly mature appearing fat with atypical stromal cells within fibrous septa."
file28387	5582	The atypical cells have pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei.
file28387	5646	This abnormal low grade tumour is seen surrounding renal vessels at the resection margin and surrounding the ureter at the resection margin.
file28387	5788	"Atypical lipomatous tumour appears to extend to, or abut, most or all excision margins of the specimen."
file28387	5892	"The atypical lipomatous tumour involves perinephric and other fat which appeared normal macroscopically, as well as the described circumscribed fatty nodules."
file28387	6051	The appearances overall are of an atypical lipomatous tumour with component of high grade spindle cell sarcoma (dedifferentiated liposarcoma).
file28387	6194	There is a separate small deposit of spindle cell tumour which is present at the deep excision margin in the inferior part of the specimen (block C10); this is considered to be a separate small focus of dedifferentiation.
file28387	6416	There is some adrenal cortical tissue at the posterosuperior end of the specimen and this is unremarkable.
file28387	6523	"Sections of the cysts at the superior pole of the kidney show that these are lined by clear cells with low grade nuclei, and groups and cords of similar clear cells within septae between the cysts."
file28387	6721	"Most of the tumour has features of a multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential but there is one more sheet-like solid area of tumour, 3mm diameter, consistent with clear cell renal cell carcinoma of conventional type (block C21)."
file28387	6972	There is no lymphovascular invasion or spread outside the kidney.
file28387	7038	Also in the kidney there is a circumscribed papillary tumour with oncocytic features measuring 8mm diameter (block C19).
file28387	7160	The tumour cells stain weakly positive for AMACR and also show some positive staining for epithelial membrane antigen but are vimentin negative.
file28387	7306	Despite the fact that the tumour is only 8mm diameter the histologic features would be very unusual for a papillary adenoma and are favoured to be those of an oncocytic papillary renal cell carcinoma.
file28387	7508	There is limited data about these tumours but there are thought to be low grade with infrequent recurrence or metastasis.
file28387	7630	Sections of kidney elsewhere show features of mild benign nephrosclerosis but are otherwise unremarkable.
file28387	7736	The atypical lipomatous tumour extends to just outside the renal capsule but does not involve the kidney itself.

file30453	2589	"There is variable nuclear pleomorphism with areas of nuclear enlargement of hyperchromasia admixed with spindle cells which are relatively bland, the latter especially seen at the tumour perimete. difficult."
file30453	2798	Mitoses number up to 30 per 10 hpf and there is patchy necrosis.
file30453	2864	Margins:
file30453	2873	Assessing margins of clearance is extremely difficult because at its periphery  infiltrative tumour appears to merge with adjacent spindle cell scar tissue.
file30453	3031	"At the deep aspect the tumour mostly abuts the fascia and not penetrate it, however, focally relatively bland spindle cells, favoured to represent tumour, appear to penetrate the fascia and just reach the deep margin over a front of approximately 0.4mm (block 11)."
file30453	3297	Radially the tumour appears to extend outwards as thin bands within the plane of the subcutis as does organising scar.
file30453	3417	"Although apparently petering out towards the margins  and becoming less cellular, the  tumour appears to focally reach both the anterior and posterior radial margins (blocks 10, 12  and 7)."
file30453	3608	Patchy haemosiderin and neovascularisation is present amongst tumour cells.
file30453	3686	"Elsewhere along the anterior and posterior margin centrally within the specimen, the tumour appears to extend close to this margin but is probably clear."
file30453	3841	Probable hypocellular tumour also reaches the inferior margin (block 16).
file30453	3916	The superior margin appears clear by at least 5mm.
file30453	3967	Selected slides of the margins were seen in consultation with Dr A Lyew who agrees that assessment of clearance is difficult but that the margins  are positive as above.
file30453	4139	COMMENT:
file30453	4148	The features are similar to those described in the report of the previous biopsy reviewed by Prof Miss RONCO in which diagnosis of intermediate myxofibrosarcoma was rendered.

file30728	5847	MSH2  Preserved nuclear staining
file30728	5880	MSH6  Preserved nuclear staining
file30728	5914	COMMENT 1:
file30728	5925	"Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene."
file30728	6194	"Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype."
file30728	6335	COMMENT 2:
file30728	6346	The features are those of an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with mucinous features and the PAX8 expression is consistent with a primary tumour.
file30728	6487	Some of the morphology features raise consideration of an endocervical rather than endometrial  primary.
file30728	6592	"The epicentre of the tumour cannot be determined due to its extensive nature, replacing the endometrium and much of the cervix."
file30728	6721	An in-situ component is also not identified.
file30728	6768	"The immunoprofile is conflicting;  the Vimentin negative, almost diffuse P16 expression is more typical of an endocervical primary while the strong diffuse ER (repeat stain pending) is more often seen in an endometrial primary."
file30728	6997	"Furthermore, this panel may not be reliable in distinguishing endometrial from endocervicial  origin as the tumour shows variant (mucinous) morphology and the panel is more reliable in tumours with classical morphology."
file30728	7217	Therefore an endometrial primary cannot be excluded.
file30728	7271	Further correlation with the clinical features and previous pathology may be beneficial.

file5423	14292	The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.
file5423	14346	COMMENT:
file5423	14355	"The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits."
file5423	14564	"The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary."
file5423	14811	"High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample."
file5423	14895	The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas).
file5423	15057	Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.
file5423	15229	"The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case."
file5423	15484	"However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded."
file5423	15805	"The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms."
file5423	16103	"The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation."
file5423	16283	In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.
file5423	16492	This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.
file5423	16585	"The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness."
file5423	16759	Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr X Maino who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries.
file5423	16933	"Dr Rogelio comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare."
file5423	17186	Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file9042	14337	COMMENT:
file9042	14346	"The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits."
file9042	14555	"The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary."
file9042	14802	"High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample."
file9042	14886	The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas).
file9042	15048	Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.
file9042	15220	"The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case."
file9042	15475	"However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded."
file9042	15796	"The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms."
file9042	16094	"The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation."
file9042	16274	In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.
file9042	16483	This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.
file9042	16576	"The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness."
file9042	16750	Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr J Moniot who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries.
file9042	16925	"Dr Gonzalo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare."
file9042	17178	Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file9392	9037	Immunostains for MSI proteins (MACQUARIE WARD NORMANTON HOSPITAL; block: A8)
file9392	9115	MLH1:   POSITIVE
file9392	9132	PMS2:  POSITIVE
file9392	9148	MSH2:  POSITIVE
file9392	9164	MSH6:  POSITIVE
file9392	9181	Comment:
file9392	9190	"Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme."
file9392	9420	"Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype."
file9392	9555	The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use.
file9392	9631	"Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible."

file9762	456	MACROSCOPIC:
file9762	469	"Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right hemicolectomy&amp;quot;, consists of right hemicolectomy specimen measuring 130mm in length, consisting of 50mm of terminal ileum incontinuum with 110mm of caecum and ascending colon."
file9762	688	There is attached appendix measuring 50mm in length with an outer diameter of 4mm.
file9762	772	Mesocolon measures up to 50mm.
file9762	804	"Situated 75mm from the proximal resection margin, 40mm from distal resection margin is a plaque like lesion measuring 35mm x 30mm occupying 90% of the open luminal circumference."
file9762	984	The tumour is on the mesenteric surface.
file9762	1026	The serosal surface shows fat wrapping around the tumour area.
