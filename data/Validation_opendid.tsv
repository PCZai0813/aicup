1059	3925	"A.  Sections show a biphasic synovial sarcoma which is partly cystic and partly solid.  Most of the solid component has an appearance similar to the previous core biopsy (19A88853).  This comprises mainly spindle cells in short irregularfascicles and also admixed more epithelioid cells forming palisades and occasional poorly formed gland-like structures. The tumour cells have elongated and oval nuclei with fine chromatin, generally small nucleoli and scanty, poorly defined eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is also a minor component, around 20% of the tumour sampled, where there is very obvious formation of well formed glands lined by columnar cells, with intervening spindle cell tumour.  The tumour cysts are generally surrounded by a thin rim of solid tumour and are lined by spindled tumour cells.  There are scattered foci of calcification within the tumour.  Mitoses number up toaround 8 per 10 high power fields.  No necrosis is seen.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  There is some patchy collagenous and myxoid fibrosis adjacent to the tumour, particularly inferiorly, and this presumably represents tumour which has now regressed due to chemotherapy.  However this fibrosis is not particularly prominent and all the tumour identified macroscopically appears to be viable histologically."	IDNUM:19A88853\nDATE:now=>2013-05-01

1066	3008	"The peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours are malignant spindle cell and epithelioid tumours, respectively. Both tumours have a similar pattern of immunohistochemical staining, and the overall appearance is similar to the retroperitoneal high grade epithelioid and spindle cell sarcoma previously described in the pathology slide review from South Africa in 2057 (51G89448YRC Worldwide). These peritoneal wall and intra-abdominal tumours most likely represent a spectrum of morphological atypia within a high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Although no lipoblasts are seen, it is possible that these tumours represent foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, which could be confirmed with FISH testing for MDM2 amplification."

The positive neurofilament stain (NF6S), however, would support a cellular neurofibroma with atypia. The mitoses, up to 3mm/2. would support low grade malignancy for this tumour which is composed of poorly defined bundles of small spindle cells. The proliferation index - up to 10% nuclei positive with Ki67 could also fit a low grade malignancy."	DOCTOR:PEARL Beskom\nDOCTOR:U Stauss\nDOCTOR:U Sandhaus

583	6939	"The invasive thymoma is difficult to subclassify.  The tumour shows definite WHO type A areas and separate micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma areas. By definition these subtypes lack nuclear atypia.  However, the type A tumour appears to transition to foci showing at least mild nuclear atypia and tumour cell mitoses. These areas don't quite correspond to typical B3 morphology of the WHO classification, as there are no squamoid features or raisinoid nuclear morphology.  I am not sure if these foci represent the WHO spindle cell variant of B3 subtype.  According to the Suster Moran classification of thymomas, which divides thymomas into well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated grading categories, and in which the poorly differentiated subtype corresponds to thymic carcinoma, the presence of cellular atypia and mitoses in this tumour warrants classification as a moderately differentiated thymoma (atypical thymoma).

The tumour has been extensively sampled.  There is moderate variability in size and shape of adipocytes but no lipoblasts are identified and no atypical cells areidentified in the fibrous bands or elsewhere.  There are no histologic features to suggest malignancy.  The tumour appeared well circumscribed macroscopically but histologically itabuts excision margins.  Adequacy of excision is difficult to assess.  Focally at the edge of the tumour there may be some extension into adjacent skeletal muscle (blocks O5, O5); this is a feature described in intramuscular lipomas."	IDNUM:O5\nIDNUM:O5

It has a lobulated contour and is composed of pleomorphic malignant spindled, stellate and multinucleated cells. In most areas, these malignant cells appear to be haphazardly arrangedwhile whorled structures are seen in other areas. Scattered foci of osteosarcomatous component are present (Block 17). The surrounding fatty tissue show adipocytic cells with mild size variation in which atypical hyperchromatic cells are seen in the stroma of their fibrocollagenous septae. The aggregate of features is consistent with that of a malignant sarcoma with a dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising from a well differentiated sclerosing type liposarcoma being favoured."

840	5413	"The H&E sections supplied are Blocks 17 to 24 from the single largest lymph node which is virtually replaced by a malignant spindle cell tumour. These sections also include 3 separate smaller lymph nodes which show reactive changes and appear uninvolved by malignancy. The tumour is composed of short and intersecting fascicles of spindled cells with occasional small groupings of more epithelioid cells. The tumour cells show considerable nuclear pleomorphism with prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, vesicular chromatin and plentiful eosinophilic cytoplasm. Occasional tumour giant cells areseen. There are scattered foci of tumour necrosis and there is brisk mitotic activity with occasional atypical mitoses. These cells show both cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for S100 protein as well as staining for vimentin, fascin andWT1 (WT1 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH stain). These cells appear negative for melan-A and HMB45 both on the Devon Energy stains and PATHOLOGYWEST stains. They are also negative on our staining for tyrosinase and MITF1.  Schmorl's stain for melanin is negative. They are also negative for multiple cytokeratins including pan cytokeratin, cytokeratin 19 and the cytokeratins listed in Dr Jamison's report. They are also negative for EMA. The tumour cells appear negative for leukocyte common antigen, CD20, CD3, CD30, PAX-5 and EBV-LMP. They appear negative for histiocytic and dendritic cell markers CD163, CD68, CD1a, langerin, CD21, CD23, CD35, and CD4, which highlight background histiocytic and dendritic cells only. They are negative for smooth muscle markers Desmin and smooth muscle actin.	DEPARTMENT:INTENSIVE CARE UNIT SOUTH\nORGANIZATION:Devon Energy\nDEPARTMENT:PATHOLOGYWEST\nDOCTOR:Jamiso"	
840	6305	"Overall, I think the most likely diagnosis is metastatic melanoma. I have not had much experience with interdigitating reticulum cell sarcoma as these are rare tumours, but from the literature they are describedas usually having more bland nuclei without necrosis and a lower mitotic rate and they often show variable staining for CD68, lysozyme and CD45. Review of the atypical melanocytic lesion removed from the left arm in 2061 is recommended.If you have access to SOX10 immunoperoxidase, this might prove helpful.  Unfortunately we have only just received a sample of the antibody and have not been able to get it working as yet. Electromicroscopy might also be considered if there is still doubt over the diagnosis after review of the skin lesion."	DATE:2061=>2061

The identification of this component would mean, therefore, that the high grade sarcoma identified in the specimens A and C, and the osteosarcoma identified in the previous resection from 2059, are most consistent with components of a de-differentiated liposarcoma."

The main differentialdiagnosis is hepatocellular adenoma.  Hepatocellular carcinoma usually arises in the background of cirrhosis but no cirrhosis is seen here.  Hepatocellular adenoma is strongly linked to female contraceptive pills/steroids and male cases without linkage to contraceptive pills/steroids are extremely rare.  This case will be sent to Prof Gerald SPANICEK of PROSERPINE HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued."	DOCTOR:Gerald SPANICEK\nHOSPITAL:PROSERPINE HOSPITAL

The appearance is identical to that of the previously reported small bowel carcinoid tumour (62Y96033). The deposit expands the mesentery and is partially surrounded by a cuff of variably dense fibrous tissue and mesenteric fat. Focally, the tissue overlying the tumour deposit is replaced by inflamed granulation tissue. There are scattered foci of lymphovascular space invasion. One of five sampled lymph nodes show metastatic tumour (1/5). The tumour does not involve the overlying bowel wall. The bowel adjacent to the presumed anastomotic site show mild non-specific mucosal chronic inflammatory change with expansion of the lamina propria and thickened intestinal villi. The bowel wall is viable and there are scattered serosal adhesions, including a focal mild foreign body response to polarisable (?suture) material. The surgical margins appear clear of tumour."

Specimen labelled ""Whipple's"" (The specimen is orientated by the surgical registrar Kassie Dumars, who describes a large piece of fatty tissue at pancreatic head, a ragged area behind the large piece of tissue as vascular groove and a piece of pancreas with ragged margin as surgical margin of the uncinate process), consists of Whipple's resection composed of duodenum 150 x 30 x 30mm, gallbladder 90 x 30 x 30mm and head of pancreas 60 x 55 x 50mm. The pancreas appears deformed by a large solid mass 60 x 50 x 40mm. The pancreas is inked as follows: Light green neck of the pancreas, blue anterior margin, black posterior margin, red vascular bed and green surgical margin of the uncinate process.  The pancreas is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into seven slices.  Slice 1 - most superior pancreas; 7 - most inferior pancreas. On sectioning the tumour appears well circumscribed, partly encapsulated with a solid and fleshy cut surface with areas of haemorrhage.  The tumour is less than 1mm from anterior margin, abuts the vascular margin and is 5mm from the surgical margin of the uncinate process and 15mm from posterior margin."	DOCTOR:Kassie Dumars

There is a 40mm malignant dermocutaneous tumour with similar morphology as that seen in the previous excision from Laverty Pathology (labelled 09-YANF 13231 Wyont, B 099051132; see also review report by Dr B Depung 09Y05113). The tumour is composed of sheets and short fascicles of pleomorphic spindled and epithelioid cells as well as malignant multinucleated cellswith bizarre, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic figures are prominent. The appearance is that of a malignant dermocutaneous tumour with features consistent with a malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma shows invasion into underlying skeletal muscle but no connection to the epidermis is seen. No obvious lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified."

A wire mesh stent is located in the duodenum but not attached to any structures which measured 62mm in length by a diameter of 12mm.  There are orientating sutures on the pancreas (three denoting uncinate process, two denoting SMA margin, and one denoting the portal vein margin).  The common bile duct margin is not macroscopically discernible, and the fellow for Dr Bursi also could not identify the common bile duct margin.  The stapled stomach margin is inked blue and the distal duodenal margin is inked black.  The gastric and duodenal mucosa appear macroscopically unremarkable.  The pancreatic neck margin measures 22 x 15mm.  The portal vein margin is inked blue, the SMA margin inked red, and the uncinate process inked green, and the anterior and posterior surface of pancreas inked black.

file5423	17345	"The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr X Maino who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Rogelio comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case."	DOCTOR:X Maino\nDOCTOR:Rogelio

file9042	17337	"The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr J Moniot who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Gonzalo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case."	DOCTOR:J Moniot\nDOCTOR:Gonzalo
